# Flappy Bird – Java Mini Project  
A simple **Flappy Bird clone** built in **Java (AWT & Swing)**.  
This project was created to practice GUI programming, event handling, and game logic in Java.  

Flappy Bird is a mobile game where players tap the screen to make a bird flap and fly through gaps between pipes. The bird constantly falls due to gravity, and the game ends if it hits a pipe or the ground. Simple yet challenging, it’s known for being highly addictive.
